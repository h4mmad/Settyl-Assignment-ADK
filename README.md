### Agent Design
- â€‹ Describe the overall architecture of your agent. How would it be structured
	using the ADK framework?
- What are the key components of your agent (e.g., intents, entities, fulfillment
logic, data stores)?
- How will the agent handle user input (e.g., a single HSN code, multiple HSN
codes)?
- How will the agent provide its validation output?
